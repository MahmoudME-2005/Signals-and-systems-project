# Signals and Systems Project

This is a Python-based project developed for the **ECE251: Signals and Systems Fundamentals** course. It focuses on analyzing and processing audio signals using essential signal processing techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and process audio signals
- Visualize signals in time and frequency domains
- Apply Fourier Transform (FFT)
- Filter signals and observe the effects

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Soundfile
- Sounddevice

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Run this command in the terminal:
```bash
